## LL-001: Rich Terminal Bracket Escaping and Pydantic Model Reordering

- **Date**: 2026-09-20
- **Scope**: project
- **Context**: During CLI live streaming and TraceReplayer unit test implementation, bracketed tokens like `[key=xyz]` or `[ΔS mutated]` were being interpreted by Rich as markup/style tags and silently stripped when rendering to plain or unstyled consoles. Furthermore, in Pydantic v2 domain models, cross-referencing types (`ReliabilityScorecard` inside `ExecutionTrace`) requires either forward reference updates or strict topological definition ordering.
- **Root Cause**: Rich treats all single square brackets `[...]` as markup instructions unless escaped as `\[...]`. Pydantic models referencing each other fail static type evaluation if dependent models are defined after the parent without postponed annotations.
- **Lesson / Rule**: Always escape literal brackets in Rich console render strings (`\[key=...]`). Structure Pydantic domain models in bottom-up topological dependency order.
